My name is Jason Lyu and I am an open-source developer, geek, and a big fan of TV shows. I hold a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Network Engineering from [Hangzhou Dianzi University](https://www.hdu.edu.cn/), where I gained a solid foundation in the field.

As a passionate open-source developer, I am always eager to be part of the vibrant open-source community. My interest extends beyond technology and into a variety of areas. My primary areas of interests include networking, software engineering, computer systems, and cloud computing. I am always exploring new technologies and keeping up to date with the latest advancements in these fields.

When it comes to my favorite TV shows and movies, I have a diverse taste. From the Star Wars franchise, including the highly-acclaimed The Mandalorian, to the beloved Doctor Who, and the magical world of Harry Potter. I also love the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with its iconic characters like Iron Man, Hulk, The Punisher, Wolverine, and Deadpool. DC Comics also holds a special place in my heart, especially when it comes to the legendary Bruce Wayne. My love for TV shows includes Friends, HIMYM, TBBT, and the brilliant detective work of Sherlock.

In short, I am a well-rounded individual with a passion for technology and a love for TV shows and movies.
