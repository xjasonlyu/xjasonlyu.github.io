I am an M.Eng. student of Computing and Software (CAS) at [McMaster University](https://mcmaster.ca/). Previously, I obtained my bachelor‚Äôs degree in Network Engineering from [Hangzhou Dianzi University](https://www.hdu.edu.cn/).

As a passionate open-source developer, I am always eager to be part of the vibrant open-source community. My interest extends beyond technology and into a variety of areas. My primary areas of interests include networking, software engineering, computer systems, microservices, and cloud computing. I am always exploring new technologies and keeping up to date with the latest advancements in these fields.

When it comes to my favorite TV shows and movies, I have a diverse taste. From the Star Wars franchise, including the highly-acclaimed The Mandalorian, to the beloved Doctor Who, and the magical world of Harry Potter. I also love the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), with its iconic characters like Iron Man, Hulk, The Punisher, Wolverine, and Deadpool. DC Comics also holds a special place in my heart, especially when it comes to the legendary Bruce Wayne. My love for TV shows includes Friends, HIMYM, TBBT, the Sherlock, etc.

In short, I am a well-rounded individual with a passion for technology and a love for TV shows and movies. Feel free to contact me via email or follow me on twitter. üòâ
